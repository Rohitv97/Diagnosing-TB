# Diagnosing-TB
Using Neural Networks on Chest Xrays to find abnormal and normal xrays to diagnose for Pulmonary Tuberculosis


## Dataset
The data was taken from Kaggle.

The CNN was applied to a combination of 2 datasets.

###  China Set

The standard digital image database for Tuberculosis is created by the National Library of Medicine, Maryland, USA in collaboration with Shenzhen No.3 People’s Hospital, Guangdong Medical College, Shenzhen, China. The Chest X-rays are from out-patient clinics, and were captured as part of the daily routine using Philips DR Digital Diagnose systems. Number of X-rays:

* 336 cases with manifestation of tuberculosis, and
* 326 normal cases.

It is requested that publications resulting from the use of this data attribute the source (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA and Shenzhen No.3 People’s Hospital, Guangdong Medical College, Shenzhen, China) and cite the following publications:

### Montogomery County Set

X-ray images in this data set have been acquired from the tuberculosis control program of the Department of Health and Human Services of Montgomery County, MD, USA. This set contains 138 posterior-anterior x-rays, of which 80 x-rays are normal and 58 x-rays are abnormal with manifestations of tuberculosis. All images are de-identified and available in DICOM format. The set covers a wide range of abnormalities, including effusions and miliary patterns. The data set includes radiology readings available as a text file.
